Feature: Testing Infrastructure
  As a maintainer, I provide testing tools,
  so contributors can verify their work without manual effort.

  Scenario: Projects use shared BDD utilities
    Given a project needs BDD testing
    Then it should import from "@agentxjs/devtools/bdd":
      | utility              | purpose                        |
      | createCucumberConfig | Cucumber configuration         |
      | agentUiTester        | AI-driven UI testing           |
      | agentDocTester       | AI-driven document evaluation  |
      | startDevServer       | Dev server lifecycle           |
      | paths                | Consistent path resolution     |

  Scenario: UI scenarios are tested by agentUiTester
    Given a contributor writes a @ui scenario
    Then steps should accumulate instructions in an array
    And the After hook should call agentUiTester with all instructions
    And agentUiTester uses Claude CLI + agent-browser to test
    And it returns PASS or FAIL with a reason

  Scenario: Documentation is tested by agentDocTester
    Given a contributor writes documentation
    Then agentDocTester should evaluate the doc from reader's experience:
      | dimension    | what it checks                           |
      | Completeness | All required information is present      |
      | Logic        | Structure flows naturally, no jumps      |
      | Readability  | A newcomer can follow without confusion  |
    And it reads the file content and sends to Claude for review
    And it returns PASS or FAIL based on whether requirements are met

  Scenario: Running tests uses the bdd CLI
    Given a project with BDD tests
    Then these commands should work:
      | command                           | what it does                    |
      | bun run bdd                       | Run non-UI tests                |
      | bun run bdd:ui                    | Run UI tests (opt-in)           |
      | bun run bdd:ui -- --tags "@setup" | Run specific UI scenario        |
      | bun run bdd:docs                  | Run documentation tests         |

  Scenario: VCR records external API calls
    Given a journey that calls external APIs
    Then it must use "createVcrDriver" from devtools
    And VCR mode is controlled by VCR_MODE environment variable
    And fixtures are stored in the project's "bdd/fixtures/recording/"
