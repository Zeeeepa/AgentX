              "text": "This repository, Deepractice/AgentX, is a full-stack application that provides a visual AI agent interface for interacting with Anthropic's Claude AI, eliminating the need for command-line tools  . Its purpose is to make AI agent capabilities accessible through a user-friendly web UI, offering features like session management, real-time streaming, and tool integration . The key functionality revolves around enabling users to chat with the AI, manage conversations, and allow the AI to perform actions like executing code or accessing files .\n\n## Purpose and Core Philosophy\n\nThe core philosophy of Deepractice AgentX is to provide a \"full-stack desktop-class application\" that offers AI agent capabilities through a web interface, moving away from command-line-only interactions  . It aims to simplify the user experience by offering a visual chat interface for interacting with AI, managing sessions, and integrating tools, all within a self-hosted environment . The project follows a \"separated development, unified deployment\" architecture, meaning components are developed independently but deployed as a single unit .\n\n## Main Features\n\nDeepractice AgentX offers several key features:\n*   **Visual Chat Interface**: It provides a modern, React-based web UI for interacting with the Claude AI, removing the need for terminal commands  .\n*   **Session Management**: Users can organize and revisit their conversations with the AI . Sessions are persisted in an SQLite database .\n*   **Real-time Streaming**: The application displays AI responses in real-time as they are generated .\n*   **Tool Integration**: The AI agent can execute code, access files, and perform other operations through tool integration . For example, it can access a `CLAUDE.md` file in the project directory for context .\n*   **Self-hosted and Browser-based**: The application runs locally on the user's machine, ensuring data privacy, and can be accessed from any device on the network via a web browser .\n*   **All-in-One Package**: The server, web UI, and CLI are bundled into a single deployable unit, simplifying installation and deployment  .\n\n## Key Functionality and Architecture\n\nThe system is built with a three-tier architecture within a monorepo structure :\n\n### Tier 1: Frontend (React)\nThe frontend is a single-page application built with React 18, utilizing Zustand for state management and an EventBus pattern for asynchronous operations . It follows a unidirectional data flow: Components call Store actions, which emit EventBus events, leading to Store handlers updating the state and re-rendering components . Key components include `ChatInterface` for the main conversation UI, `useSessionStore` and `useMessageStore` for state management, and `WebSocketClient` for real-time communication .\n\n### Tier 2: Backend (Express + WebSocket)\nThe backend provides REST APIs for session management and WebSocket streaming for real-time communication . It delegates all AI operations to the Agent SDK . Important modules include the Express server entry point (`apps/agent/server/index.ts`), session API routes (`apps/agent/server/routes/sessions.ts`), and WebSocket chat handling (`apps/agent/server/websocket/chat.ts`) . The backend also includes a CLI (`apps/agent/cli/index.ts`) for command-line interactions .\n\n### Tier 3: Agent SDK (RxJS Event-Driven)\nThe Agent SDK (`packages/agent-sdk/`) provides a reactive abstraction over the Anthropic Claude API using RxJS Observables for streaming . It manages session lifecycles and handles interactions with the Anthropic API . Core classes include `ClaudeAgent`, `SessionManager`, `ClaudeSession`, and `ClaudeAdapter` . The SDK is event-driven, with all state changes emitting RxJS Observable events .\n\n## Deployment and Development\n\nThe application is designed for unified deployment, where the frontend, backend, and CLI are bundled into a single npm package (`@deepractice-ai/agent`)  . It can be deployed via npm CLI, Docker run, or Docker Compose  . For development, a separate Vite development server runs for the frontend, allowing for Hot Module Replacement (HMR), while the backend runs independently . In production, the agent server on port 5200 serves everything, including static frontend files, API, and WebSocket connections .\n\n## Notes\n\nThe `CLAUDE.md` file in the repository is primarily for providing guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the codebase, rather than being a core functional component of the Deepractice AgentX application itself . However, the application does have a feature to access a `CLAUDE.md` file within a project for context, as seen in the `/memory` command handler .\n\nWiki pages you might want to explore:\n- [First Conversation (Deepractice/AgentX)](/wiki/Deepractice/AgentX#2.3)\n- [Architecture Overview (Deepractice/AgentX)](/wiki/Deepractice/AgentX#3)\n\nView this search on DeepWiki: https://deepwiki.com/search/what-is-this-repository-about_5500250f-7c53-4904-a542-62d22b10c84f\n"
