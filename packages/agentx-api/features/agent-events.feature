Feature: Agent Event Handling
  As a developer
  I want to listen for agent events
  So that I can respond to different stages of the conversation

  Background:
    Given I have created an agent

  Scenario: Listen for assistant messages
    Given I register a handler for "assistant" events
    When the agent sends a response
    Then my handler should be called with the assistant message event

  Scenario: Listen for result events
    Given I register a handler for "result" events
    When the conversation completes
    Then my handler should be called with the result event
    And I can check if it was successful or had an error

  Scenario: Unregister event handlers
    Given I have registered a handler for "assistant" events
    When I unregister the handler
    And the agent sends a response
    Then my handler should NOT be called

  Scenario: Multiple handlers for same event
    Given I register handler A for "assistant" events
    And I register handler B for "assistant" events
    When the agent sends a response
    Then both handler A and B should be called

  Scenario: Event handlers receive typed data
    Given I register a handler for "result" events
    When the result event is emitted
    Then the handler parameter should have the correct type
    And I can access result-specific fields without type casting

  Scenario: Listen for system initialization
    Given I register a handler for "system" events with subtype "init"
    When the agent initializes
    Then I should receive the system init event
    And it should include model information
    And it should include available tools
    And it should include the current working directory

  Scenario: Stream events during response
    Given I register a handler for "stream_event" events
    When the agent is generating a response
    Then I should receive multiple stream events
    And I can display real-time progress to the user
