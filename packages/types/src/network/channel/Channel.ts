/**
 * Channel - Bidirectional communication medium between Ecosystems
 *
 * Channel is the transport layer that connects two Ecosystems.
 * It does not belong to any Ecosystem - it's the infrastructure
 * that enables Ecosystems to communicate.
 *
 * From systems theory perspective:
 * - Ecosystem A's Effector → Channel → Ecosystem B's Receptor
 * - Ecosystem B's Effector → Channel → Ecosystem A's Receptor
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Client side
 * const channel = new WebSocketChannel({ url: "ws://localhost:5200" });
 * await channel.connect();
 *
 * // Send events to server
 * channel.send({ type: "message_send_request", data: { content: "Hello" } });
 *
 * // Receive events from server
 * channel.on((event) => {
 *   console.log("Received:", event.type);
 * });
 * ```
