/**
 * ImageRecord - Storage schema for AgentImage persistence
 *
 * Pure data type representing an image (frozen snapshot) in storage.
 * Contains serialized definition and messages for resume/fork capability.
 *
 * Part of Docker-style layered architecture:
 * Definition → build → Image → run → Agent
 *
 * Supports two image types:
 * - 'meta': Genesis image (auto-created from Definition)
 * - 'derived': Committed image (from session.commit())
 *
 * Note: Environment-specific state (e.g., Claude SDK session_id) is stored
 * separately in EnvironmentRecord, not here. This keeps ImageRecord clean
 * and focused on business-layer concerns.
