/**
 * Receptor - Perceives the external world and emits to SystemBus
 *
 * From systems theory:
 * - A receptor is a sensory component that detects stimuli from outside
 * - It transforms external signals into events the system can process
 *
 * In our architecture:
 * - Receptor perceives external world (LLM API, Network, etc.)
 * - Emits events to SystemBus
 *
 * ```
