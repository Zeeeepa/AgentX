/**
 * Agent Stream Events
 *
 * Real-time streaming events during AI response generation.
 * These events are transformed from DriveableEvent by Driver.
 *
 * Flow:
 * ```
 * Receptor → DriveableEvent { turnId }
 *                ↓
 * Driver (filter by turnId, add agentId)
 *                ↓
 * AgentStreamEvent { context: { agentId, turnId } }
 *                ↓
 * Engine.process()
 * ```
 *
 * Key Design:
 * - DriveableEvent has turnId (from Receptor)
 * - Driver filters events by turnId
 * - Driver transforms to AgentStreamEvent, adding agentId
 * - Engine processes AgentStreamEvent
