/**
 * AgentDriver - Message Processing Interface
 *
 * AgentDriver is a pure message processor.
 * It receives user messages and yields DriveableEvents.
 *
 * Key Design:
 * - One Agent = One Driver instance
 * - Driver only handles message processing
 * - Lifecycle management is Container's responsibility
 * - Resume/history is Container's responsibility
 *
 * Type Relationship:
 * ```
 * EnvironmentEvent (all external perceptions)
 * │
 * ├── DriveableEvent (can drive Agent) ← Driver outputs this
 * │   └── MessageStartEvent, TextDeltaEvent, ToolCallEvent...
 * │
 * └── ConnectionEvent (network status only)
 *     └── ConnectedEvent, DisconnectedEvent
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * class ClaudeDriver implements AgentDriver {
 *   readonly name = "ClaudeDriver";
 *
 *   async *receive(message: UserMessage) {
 *     const stream = this.client.messages.stream({
 *       model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
 *       messages: [{ role: "user", content: message.content }],
 *     });
 *
 *     for await (const chunk of stream) {
 *       yield transformToDriveableEvent(chunk);
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   interrupt() {
 *     this.abortController.abort();
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
