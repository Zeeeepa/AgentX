/**
 * DerivedImage - Image created from session.commit()
 *
 * Part of Docker-style layered architecture:
 * Definition → [auto] → MetaImage → Session → [commit] → DerivedImage
 *
 * DerivedImage is created when a Session commits its state.
 * It captures the conversation history for resume/fork capability.
 *
 * Characteristics:
 * - Always has a parentImageId (MetaImage or another DerivedImage)
 * - messages contains the committed conversation history
 * - Can be used as base for new Sessions (fork capability)
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Create session from MetaImage
 * const session = await agentx.sessions.create(metaImage.imageId, userId);
 *
 * // ... conversation happens ...
 *
 * // Commit session to create DerivedImage
 * const derivedImage = await session.commit();
 *
 * // Fork: create new session from DerivedImage
 * const forkedSession = await agentx.sessions.create(derivedImage.imageId, userId);
 * ```
