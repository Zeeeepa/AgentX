/**
 * RecordingDriver - Wraps a real driver to record events
 *
 * Used to capture real LLM API responses and save them as fixtures.
 * These fixtures can then be played back by MockDriver for testing.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```typescript
 * // Wrap the real Claude driver
 * const realDriver = claudeFactory.createDriver(options);
 * const recorder = createRecordingDriver({
 *   driver: realDriver,
 *   name: "my-scenario",
 *   description: "User asks about weather",
 * });
 *
 * // Use recorder like a normal driver
 * recorder.connect(consumer, producer);
 *
 * // After conversation, save the fixture
 * await recorder.saveFixture("./fixtures/my-scenario.json");
 * ```
