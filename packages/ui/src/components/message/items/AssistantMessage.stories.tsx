1. **Type Safety** - Catch errors at compile time

4. **Self-Documenting** - Types serve as documentation

**Vercel** is one of the easiest platforms for deploying React apps. It's free for personal projects and offers excellent performance with automatic HTTPS and global CDN. Simply connect your GitHub repository and Vercel will automatically deploy on every push.

**Netlify** is another fantastic option that's similar to Vercel. It also offers a generous free tier, automatic deployments from Git, and built-in CI/CD. Both platforms support environment variables and custom domains.

**AWS S3 + CloudFront** is a more traditional approach that gives you more control. You can host your static files on S3 and use CloudFront as a CDN. This option is great if you're already using AWS services.

For setting up CI/CD, I recommend using GitHub Actions. You can create a workflow that builds your app, runs tests, and deploys to your chosen platform automatically whenever you push to your main branch.`,
